summary: Amazon Cognito is really ok, kinda of confusing. In this article, I am going to review how to use it and show you how much I still don't know but I know a lot to get the freaking work done. Anyway...just let's keep, keeping on. What else can be done.

AWS Codepipeline is an excellent option for your CI/CD Option. In this article, I will walk you through setting using Github and AWS to set up your CI/CD pipeline.

What Does CI/CD actually mean and why has it become so popular in the last few years. I'm just trying to mimic those blog writter out there.  I have so much work to do but I am really grateful for the last few days because I was finally able to get my butt out of bed. I don't know where this road is going to lead but I'm here, walking it alone. I just need to really push through.

</div>


<Note data="This is very important. Also, how do I escape character's All the time. This is the best part of my job you know. What else don't I know"/>
