summary: Did they get you trade, your heros for ghost. Hot ashes trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold confort for change. Did you exchange, a walk on part in a war, for a lead role in cage. How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost soulds swimming in a fish bowl year after year.

AWS Codepipeline is an excellent option for your CI/CD Option. In this article, I will walk you through setting using Github and AWS to set up your CI/CD pipeline.  

<br/>

What Does CI/CD actually mean and why has it become so popular in the last few years. I'm just trying to mimic those blog writter out there.  I have so much work to do but I am really grateful for the last few days because I was finally able to get my butt out of bed. I don't know where this road is going to lead but I'm here, walking it alone. I just need to really push through.

<Subheader data='Code Pipeline Console'/>

<div class='note-bene'>
  <p> This is where I want to style notes that are important. I really should just have a component
  for this but then I would have to put all the text in the component. I'm not sure if it is worth itt.</p>
</div>


<Note data="This is very important. Also, how do I escape character's All the time. This is the best part of my job you know. What else don't I know"/>
