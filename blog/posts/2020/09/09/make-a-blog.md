## Creating a CI/CD Pipeline with AWS

AWS Codepipeline is an excellent option for your CI/CD Option. In this article, I will walk you through setting using Github and AWS to set up your CI/CD pipeline.  
What Does CI/CD actually mean and why has it become so popular in the last few years. I'm just trying to mimic those blog writter out there.  I have so much work to do but I am really grateful for the last few days because I was finally able to get my butt out of bed. I don't know where this road is going to lead but I'm here, walking it alone. I just need to really push through.

```html
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```js
  function add(x, y){
    console.log('gonna return something very, very, very, long....just to check out.')
    return x+y;
  }
```

<pre><code>
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
